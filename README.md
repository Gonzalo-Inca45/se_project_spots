# Project 3 "Spots"

On this project I created an interactive social media web application where users can add and remove photos, like photos of other users on the site, and also allowing the user to create changes to their profie.

**Figma**

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma — we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

Good luck and have fun!
